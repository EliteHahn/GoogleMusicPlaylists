README

An unfinished prototype to demonstrate the uses of the GMusic API.
The project will be continued separately in a language with pattern matching to ease the user interface. 

==========
How to Use
==========
  - Note that this product is unfinished and filled with bugs, so it should not be used
  - Upon runing, the system will prompt for a username and password, which is used to log into the GMusic API
  - There are multiple commands, with varying functionality, including print, sort, and create_playlist. Again, it is not reccomended you use these unless you understand their functionality in the development stage. 

========
Problems
========
  - There's still bugs flying everywhere
  - No catch for if login fails. Program will crash
  - Missing features, no help function, and also there's not much you can do with this


============
Hype Scoring
============
General Notes
  - Score of 6 or higher means that the song is hype.
  - Score of 4 or lower means chiller songs
  - Score of 5 can work in either category
